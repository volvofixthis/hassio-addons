# Mount It

Automatically detects and mounts external USB/SATA drives. By default it exposes
them as Home Assistant network storage (CIFS) via the Supervisor Mounts API, but
you can disable that and keep the mounts local to the add-on.

## How it works

1. On startup, detected drives are mounted inside the addon at `/mnt/<label>`
2. If `expose_network_storage` is enabled, a minimal Samba server exposes each mount as a private share
3. If enabled, the HA Supervisor registers each share as network storage (Settings → Storage)
4. On shutdown, HA network mounts are cleanly removed and drives unmounted

Hot-plugging a drive while the addon is running will automatically mount it and,
when enabled, register it as network storage (if `automount_on_plugin` is enabled).

## Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mount_unlabeled` | `false` | Mount drives that have no filesystem label |
| `automount_on_plugin` | `true` | Automatically mount drives when plugged in |
| `specific_label` | `""` | If set, only this drive label is mounted (applies to startup and hot-plug) |
| `mount_location` | `media` | Where to expose drives: `media`, `share`, or `backup` |
| `expose_network_storage` | `true` | Start Samba and register mounts in Home Assistant. Disable to keep mounts local to the add-on only. |
| `hdd_idle_seconds` | `0` | Spin down drives after N seconds idle (0 = disabled). The HAOS system disk is always excluded. |
| `file_activity_detail` | `off` | File activity logging level: `off`, `basic`, or `detailed` |

When `expose_network_storage` is `false`, Mount It still mounts drives under `/mnt`, but it does not start Samba, register anything in **Settings → Storage**, or process `folder_mounts`.

## File Activity Log

Set `file_activity_detail` to `basic` or `detailed` to record file operations in
the addon log (**Settings → Add-ons → Mount It → Log**). Each operation is
written as a single line:

```txt
2026/08/10 21:04:11|172.30.32.1|DriveHDD|create_file|ok|0x80000000|file|open|/mnt/DriveHDD/Movies/clip.mkv
2026/08/10 21:04:19|172.30.32.1|DriveHDD|renameat|ok|/mnt/DriveHDD/a.txt|/mnt/DriveHDD/b.txt
2026/08/10 21:04:25|172.30.32.1|DriveHDD|unlinkat|fail|/mnt/DriveHDD/locked.bin
```

The fields are `timestamp | client IP | share | operation | ok/fail | details`.
Both successful and failed operations are recorded.

| Detail | Records |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | File activity logging is disabled |
| `basic` | Share connects/disconnects, file opens and creations, deletes, renames, and new folders |
| `detailed` | Everything in `basic`, plus closes, truncations, permission/attribute/ACL changes, and every individual read and write |

### Notes

- The shares are mounted by Home Assistant itself, so the client IP is your HA host.
- `detailed` can produce thousands of lines while copying a large file and may slow transfers.
- The log is not persisted by the addon; it lives in the addon's container log.
- Samba 4.14 or newer is required. On older versions, activity logging stays off.
- File activity logging only applies when `expose_network_storage` is enabled.

## Folder Mounts (Advanced)

You can map specific subfolders of a mounted drive to a different HA storage location.
This is useful when, for example, you store both media files and HA backups on the same drive.

**Example:** Mount `DriveHDD` drive to `media`, and also expose `DriveHDD/ha_backup` to `backup`:

```yaml
folder_mounts:
  - name: CameraMedia
    drive: DriveHDD
    folder: ha_backup
    location: backup
```

Each folder mount:

- Requires the parent drive to be mounted first
- The folder path must already exist on the drive
- Is registered in HA as a separate network storage entry
- Can use an optional `name` containing letters, numbers, and underscores
- Appears in HA using `name`, or `<DriveLabel>_<FolderPath>` when `name` is omitted

`folder_mounts` is ignored when `expose_network_storage` is disabled.

## Supported filesystems

| Filesystem | Support |

| exFAT / FAT32 / VFAT | Experimental (no ACL support) |
| APFS | Read-only, experimental (aarch64/amd64 only) |

## Requirements

- Home Assistant OS
- Protection mode **disabled** in the addon settings
